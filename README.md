# Simulating-Quantum-Systems-Lectures
These are Python notebooks for an introduction to the mathematical formalism of quantum information processing and how to simulate such tasks using Qiskit.

## Installation Instructions
These notebooks are to be worked through on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to avoid needing to manage a Python environment. As such, to use the notebooks, one simply does the following:
1. Download either this respository or the specific Python notebooks of interest.
2. Go to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Sign into your Google account.*
4. Go to `File -> Upload Notebook` and upload the relevant notebook you downloaded.
5. Enjoy!

* - If one does not want to use a Google account, they may run Jupyter notebooks through an alternative method. This however will involve installing the appropriate packages for their Python environment.
