# Simulating-Quantum-Systems-Lectures
These are Python notebooks for an introduction to the mathematical formalism of quantum information processing and how to simulate such tasks using Qiskit.

## Structure
There are two folders, each containing versions of the same Jupyter notebooks.
* **Completed-Notebooks:** Has the notebooks completed. This is for reference if something is not working or instructions are unclear.
* **Notebooks-to-Work-Through:** This contains the notebooks to be worked through during the sessions.

## Installation Instructions
These notebooks are to be worked through on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to avoid needing to manage a Python environment. As such, to use the notebooks, one simply does the following:
1. Download either this respository or the specific Python notebooks of interest.
2. Go to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Sign into your Google account.[^1]
4. Go to `File -> Upload Notebook` and upload the relevant notebook you downloaded.
5. Enjoy!

[^1]: If one does not want to use a Google account, they may run Jupyter notebooks through an alternative method. This however will involve installing the appropriate packages for their Python environment.
